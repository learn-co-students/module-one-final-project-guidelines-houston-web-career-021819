Check your owner’s manual or call the shop before purchasing your voucher to make sure you get the right type. Tire rotation helps ensure tires wear evenly. It’s an important and often-overlooked part of auto maintenance that involves adjusting the position of tires around the car. It’s recommended to rotate tires every 6,000-8,000 miles, ensuring the best tires are on the rear. Wheel alignment: It’s easy to tell when a car isn’t in alignment. Drifting from side to side, abnormally worn tires, or a tilted steering wheel while driving straight are symptoms of a vehicle in need of alignment services. Since a tire alignment actually fixes the vehicle suspension, not the tires, having a specialist who can properly adjust the suspension system is important.",

A safe bet is to refer to the mileage on the windshield sticker from your last oil change. What kind of oil should I use?: It all depends on your individual vehicle. Check your owner’s manual or call the shop before purchasing your voucher to make sure you get the right type. Tire rotation: helps ensure tires wear evenly. It’s an important and often-overlooked part of auto maintenance that involves adjusting the position of tires around the car. It’s recommended to rotate tires every 6,000-8,000 miles, ensuring the best tires are on the rear. Wheel Alignment: It’s easy to tell when a car isn’t in alignment. Drifting from side to side, abnormally-worn tires, or a tilted steering wheel while driving straight are symptoms of a vehicle in need of alignment services. Since a tire alignment actually fixes the vehicle suspension, not the tires, having a specialist who can properly adjust the suspension system is important.",

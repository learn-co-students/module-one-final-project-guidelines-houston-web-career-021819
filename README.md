  ## Instruction for New Users

- The first menu allows for you to create a new user. Input a username and password to create the account. 
- As a new user, you may add your data to the currently available `.csv` data file under the folder `/db`. You may have to edit your `.csv` file so that our application can get and retrieve your data. (Please see the following section for how to prepare your `.csv` file.)
- After you import your data, in your terminal, please type `rake db:seed`, if successful, your data should be already in our database `development.db` under `/db` folder.

  ## For New Users: How to Prepare your .CSV File?
  
- We recommend new users to generate .csv files via [Exportify](https://rawgit.com/watsonbox/exportify/master/exportify.html), a free app that automatically generates .csv file for each Spotify playlist.

- The sample data included here is a combination of several playlists for two users. After we retrieve data from [Exportify](https://rawgit.com/watsonbox/exportify/master/exportify.html), we also included account information (username and password) in the sample data file. 

- **Additional Tips**: If you are not familiar with .csv file format, please check out [Excel to CSV](https://knowledgebase.constantcontact.com/articles/KnowledgeBase/6409-saving-an-excel-file-as-a-csv-file?lang=en_US).

- **Additional Tips**: If you want to get data from other music and video sources, please check out the [Payed option for many sources](https://freeyourmusic.com/) for details.
